Please think step by step and strictly follow the specified output format for each step:
Step 1.  **Analyzing task intent**:
Analyze the intent of the given problem and identify its core objective in the context of scenario inference.   First  clarify the background of the time series data involved in the problem (e.g., the meaning of the data field, its corresponding scenario), then specifically determine whether the task requires anomaly detection, classification, calculation, or another type of task.
**Output Format**:
Step 1 Analyzing task intent:
[Judgment] <Your classification judgement (e.g., This is a anomaly detection task.   / This is a classification task.)>
[Description] <Provide a rationale for the classification based on the given problem context.   Cite specific keywords or requirements from the problem and explain how these details align with the defined task type.>
Step 2.  **Selecting task-relevant key patterns**:
Align with the task's core objective to identify core features that directly support task completion.   These features must be actionable and critical to deriving valid conclusions.   Valid pattern categories include temporal patterns (e.g., trend; amplitude; fluctuation; continuity), judgment criteria (e.g., task-specific definitions of patterns), threshold values (e.g., upper bounds; lower bounds; percentage deviations), and other decisive patterns or criteria that are critical for resolving the task.
**Output Format**:
Step 2 Selecting task-relevant key patterns:
[Judgment] <Only list the names of the selected key patterns (no extra details, analysis, or conclusions);   separate multiple items with semicolons.>
[Description] <For each selected pattern: Clarify the pattern's specific details;   explain how it aligns with the task’s core objective;   elaborate on why it is critical to match the task's core objective.
Step 3.  **Analyzing time series samples using selected key patterns**:
Clarify the specific characteristics (e.g., occurrence timing, duration, intensity) and inherent rules of the selected key patterns.   Then evaluate whether the time series sample conforms to these task-relevant patterns and criteria.    You can analyze the entire series holistically, or split it into meaningful segments (e.g., by time period, event node) based on task requirements.
**Output Format**:
Step 3 Analyzing time series samples using selected key patterns:
[Analysis] <Your analysis process.>
Step 4.  **Generating preliminary answers by combining task intent and key patterns**:
Based on the analysis of task requirements, patterns, and time series data from prior steps, formulate preliminary answers.
**Output Format**:
Step 4 Generating preliminary answers by combining task intent and key patterns:
[Judgment] <Preliminary answer.   (Select one option from the given choices.   **MUST** retain the complete original text of the option. )  > ；
[Description] <Provide a rationale for the judgement.>
Step 5.  **Enhancing answers through reflection**:
Verify whether the selection of key patterns is comprehensive, ensuring no relevant features are omitted.   Check the correctness of the analysis.   Eliminate interfering factors that may affect the validity of the analysis.
**Output Format**:
Step 5 Enhancing answers through reflection:
[Analysis] <Your reflection and verification process.>
Step 6.  **Summarizing the thinking process to output the answer**:
Integrate the entire analytical process, clearly presenting the complete logic from understanding the task, analyzing patterns, generating conclusions to verifying results.   Finally, output an answer that meets the task requirements.
**Output Format**:
Step 6 Summarizing the thinking process to output the answer:
[Description] <Summary of the reasoning process across all steps.>
[Judgment] <Final answer.   (Select one option from the given choices.   **MUST** retain the complete original text of the option.)>'''
